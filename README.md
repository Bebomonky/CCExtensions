(Replace and or Update the Index.ini)

##
If you don't want to replace Index.ini (Fearing it might crash)
Just copy this line

```bash
	ScriptPath = Base.rte/Extensions/ExtensionMan.lua
```

Put it under `	ScriptPath = Base.rte/Constants.lua`

Should look like this
```
DataModule
	ModuleName = Base Set
	ScriptPath = Base.rte/Constants.lua
	ScriptPath = Base.rte/Extensions/ExtensionMan.lua
    ...
```
